    "The file `vns.py`contains the implementation of a generic Variable Neighborhood Size (VNS) algorithm for a multi-objective optimization problem. The file `knapsack.py`contains an instance of a bi-objective knapsack problem, where the two objectives are to maximize utility and minimize weight. Review the code before running this bnotebook, that runs the algorithm on the knapsack problem, and illustrates the solutions that have been generated."
